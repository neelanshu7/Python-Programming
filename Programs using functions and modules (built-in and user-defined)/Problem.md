A. Create a Python funcMon that performs the following tasks:
  a. Accepts three parameters: length, width, and height represen7ng the
  dimensions of room.
  b. Computes the area to be whitewashed using the func7on
  whitewashing_Area().
  c. Calculates the cost of whitewashing at a rate of Rs.15/- per sq.m using the
  func7on whitewashing_Cost().
  d. Computes the cost of flooring at different rates: Rs.100/- per sq.m for mosaic
  flooring and
  e. Rs.55/- per sq.m for cement flooring using the func7on flooring_Cost().
  f. The func7on should display the calculated costs for whitewashing and
  flooring.

B. Create a Python module named marks_Calculator that encapsulates funcMonaliMes
for students' marks computaMon in different subjects. Within this module, design
a funcMon that:
  a. Takes inputs and calculates the total marks obtained by a student in various
  subjects.
  b. Computes the average marks and grade obtained by the student across all
  subjects.
  c. Returns the calculated average marks and grade.

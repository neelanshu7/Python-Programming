"""
E. Write a Python program that takes user input as a string, converts it to an integer,
performs a mathematical operation (e.g., addition or multiplication) with another
integer, and then prints the result.
"""

a=input("Enter 1st number : ")
b=input("Enter 2nd number : ")
print(type(a))
print(type(b))

print(a+b)
# Addition
print(int(a)+int(b))
# Multiplication
print(int(a)*int(b))

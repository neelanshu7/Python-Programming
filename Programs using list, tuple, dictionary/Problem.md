A. Write a Python program to create a Caesar cipher encryp7on and display input text, encrypted text and decrypted text.

B. Create a Shopping Cart Management System
  Develop a Python program to simulate a straighvorward shopping cart management system, allowing users to perform opera7ons such as adding items, viewing the cart contents, removing items, and calcula7ng the total cost of items in the cart. U7lize dic7onaries to store item details, including name, price, and quan7ty,and use a list to represent the shopping cart.

Features to Implement:
  1. Item Management:
    a. Maintain a dictionary to store item details. Each item should have a unique identifier (e.g., item code).
    b. Include information such as item name, price, and initial quan7ty in the dictionary.
  2. Shopping Cart RepresentaMon:
    a. Use a list to represent the shopping cart. Each item in the cart is identified by its unique code.
    b. The list should ini7ally be empty, signifying an empty cart.
  3. Adding Items:
    a. Allow users to add items to the shopping cart by specifying the item code and quantity.
    b. Check the availability of the item in the inventory, and update the cart accordingly.
    c. If the item is already in the cart, update the quantity.
  4. Viewing Cart Contents:
    a. Implement a function to display the current contents of the shopping cart.
    b. Display item details (name, price, quantity) for each item in the cart.
    c. Provide a message if the cart is empty.
  5. Removing Items:
    a. Allow users to remove items from the cart by specifying the item code.
    b. Ensure proper validation to handle cases where the item is not in the cart.
  6. CalculaMng Total Cost:
    a. Implement a function to calculate the total cost of items in the cart.
    b. Consider the quantity of each item and its corresponding price.
  7. User InteracMon:
    a. Implement a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and messages.
    b. Continuously prompt the user for actions (adding, viewing, removing) until they decide to exit.

C. Create a Student Gradebook Management System
  Design a Python program to manage a student gradebook, providing func7onality for adding students, inpu{ng their grades for various subjects, and calcula7ng the
  average grades for each student. U7lize dic7onaries to store student informa7on, including names and corresponding lists to store grades for different subjects.

Features to Implement:
  1. Student Management:
    a. Maintain a dic7onary to store student details. Each student should be uniquely iden7fied (e.g., student ID).
    b. Include informa7on such as student name and an ini7al empty list to store grades for different subjects.
  2. Adding Students:
    a. Allow users to add students to the gradebook by providing necessary details such as student ID and name.
    b. Assign an empty list to the student to store grades for different subjects.
  3. Grade Input:
    a. Implement a func7on to input grades for a specific student and subject.
    b. Users should be able to input grades for mul7ple subjects for a given student.
  4. Viewing Grades:
    a. Create a func7on to display the grades of a par7cular student for all subjects.
    b. Display subject names and corresponding grades for beaer user understanding.
  5. Calculating Average Grades:
    a. Develop a func7on to calculate the average grades for a par7cular student.
    b. U7lize the list of grades for each subject to calculate the average.
  6. User InteracMon:
    a. Implement a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and messages.
    b. Allow users to perform ac7ons such as adding students, inputing grades, viewing grades, and calcula7ng averages.

D. Create a Personal InformaMon Management with Tuple Packing and Unpacking
  Create a Python program that captures informa7on about a person, including their name, age, and address. U7lize tuple packing to store this informa7on in a tuple, and
  then use tuple unpacking to retrieve and display the informa7on.
  Features to Implement:
  1. InformaMon Input:
    a) Design a func7on to input details about a person, including their name, age, and address.
    b) The func7on should return a tuple containing the packed informa7on.
  2. Tuple Packing:
    a) Implement tuple packing to store the informa7on obtained from the input func7on in a tuple.
  3. Tuple Unpacking:
    a) Create a func7on to unpack the informa7on from the tuple and display it.
    b) Retrieve the name, age, and address from the tuple and print them in a readable format.
  4. User InteracMon:
    a) Implement a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and messages.
    b) Allow users to input their personal informa7on and then display it using tuple packing and unpacking.

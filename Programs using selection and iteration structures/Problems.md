A. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.
    (Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again un7l the guess is   correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.)
    
B. Write a python program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.

C. Design a program that assesses the strength of a given password based on specific criteria and categorizes it as either "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."
    1.The program should prompt the user to enter a password.
    2.The password strength is determined based on the following criteria:
        Length Check:
            The password must be at least 8 characters long.
        Case SensiMvity:
            The password should contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase leaers.
        Numeric Characters:
            The password should include at least one numeric digit.
        Special Characters:
            The password should contain at least one special character from the set: !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>
        Domain Check:
            All the mail ID must be finished with @sastra.ac.in or @sastra.edu

D. Create a Python program for a simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a user can play against the computer.
    Constraints:
    > The program should provide a menu for the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    > The computer's choice should be randomly generated.
    > The game should implement the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules:
        Rock crushes Scissors.
        Scissors cut Paper.
        Paper covers Rock.
    > The program should display the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the round.
    > The game should continue until the user chooses to exit.
    > Implement input validation to handle invalid choices from the user.

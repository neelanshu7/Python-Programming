Programs to demonstrate recursive algorithms

A. Create a class named EB_amount. It has two data members, such as units_used and bill. Use Inputdetail() member function to get input for unit_used. Upto 100 units no charges. For 101 to 200 units 3 rupees per unit, 201 to 500 units 4 rupees per unit and above 500 units 5 rupees per unit are alloted by EB. calculate the bill amount in the Calculate() member function. Display the bill amount along with the unit used in the Printdetail( ) member function. Include a constructor to initialize the value as zero for data members. Find the EB bill amount for N consumers. Writ the N consumers object details in file.

B. Create a Python program that contains a class Textile with attributes: type, size, colour, qty_on_hand, rate. Textile class has two methods namely, getDet() and putDet(). In getDet() method, get values of attributes and putDet() method should print details. Create a separate module and includes an user defined function that accepts a Textile object as an argument and stores it in a Textile_dict dictionary for N objects and calculates the total amount will be sale. Print the entire dictionary value along with total sales amount.

C. Create a class called point with x and y as the instance acributes. Include the following member funcMons in point class.
a) no argument constructor - assign zero as the initial value for x and y
b) get_input( ) - read input from the user for x and y
c) add_point() - add calling point class object with parameter point class object.
d) diff_point ( ) - calculate the distance between the calling point class object and
parameter point class object.
